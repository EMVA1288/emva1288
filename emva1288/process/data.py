"""Transform image data into data
This class takes a dictionary with image data
(product of :class:`emva1288.process.loader.LoadImageData`)
and transforms it into data that can be used for the EMVA1288 computations.
It is important to note, that this is separate from LoadImageData because this
step, produces float values that are not easily transportable (db, json,
etc...) without loosing accuracy.
